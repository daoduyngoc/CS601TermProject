                <p>
                    I graduated from DePauw University in 2015 with double majors in Computer Science and Economics. DePauw is a liberal art college located in Greencastle, IN.
                    During the time here, I learned not only about the academic subjects in the classes, but also about the American culture, and made valuable relationships. Every memory I have here is beautiful and irreplaceable.
                    The small college town will forever stay in my heart.<br><br>

                    Here is a picture of my pretty school:

                    Working at AWS isn't busy enough, I'm currently studying for my MS Computer Information System at Boston University.
                    My decision to pursue a higher degree was largely thanks to the pandemic, during which I hardly had any social interaction or traveling plans.<br><br>

                    Here is a picture of the school, which I've never been to (hopefully will be someday):
